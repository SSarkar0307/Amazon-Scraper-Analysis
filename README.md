For initializing the automation---

1) Run the amazon_soft_toys_scraper.py file to start the scraping, the results will get saved to .csv file.
NOTE: THE SCRAPING BY SELENIUM AND CHROMEDRVIER IS NOT PROPERLY FUNCTIONAL IN THIS CODE AS THE BRAND AND TITLE NAMES ARE NOT FETCHED, SO USED A DUMMY CSV DATA FOR TESTING OF CLEANING AND ANALYZING THE RESULTS
2) Run the initialize.py file.
That's it, the Anaylsis are stored in new output folder.
